#You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names. 
#The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
#Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.
#Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. 
#For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

#Example Input
#Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
#Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

#Example Output
#Michael is going to buy the meal today!
